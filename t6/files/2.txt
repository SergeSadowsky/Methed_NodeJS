While interlaced video isn't the nicest thing to read characters on, it's
   neat to be able to put nearly all of a typewritten page on the screen. Most
   of the Amiga outlets handle a neat thing called Jitter-Rid, or some such
   thing.  It is a thick piece of smoked plastic that goes on your 1080
   monitor. It enhances the contrast and attenuates the light from the screen
   to keep your brain from rattling too badly from the flicker. Also, dark
   characters on a light background seem to work best for me, anyway.
