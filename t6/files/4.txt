If you aren't afraid of working on the average modern TV set, the 1080
   shouldn't prove to be much of a problem. Looking from the back, there are
   four screws, one at each corner. You need a long Philips screwdriver for
   those. There is a bottom plate that that also needs to come off. Finally,
   there is a screw just above the RGB input connector. Now, if you place the
   monitor face down on a soft towel, you can, with a little judicious prying
   and tugging, lift the rear part of the case off. Watch out for the speaker
   lead. You will have to unplug the connector before the back can come clear
   off.
