 A number of Amiga 1080 monitors were built by Toshiba. The people at
Toshiba could have done a better job in a couple of respects:

   First, they did a poor job of extracting vertical sync pulses from the
   video signal that comes from the Amiga. This produces an error in the
   interlacing when the Amiga is used in 320x400 or 640x400 display modes.
   When you look closely at the screen you see alternating line spacings. It
   also gives characters a ragged look.  The modification described in the
   dPaintII file reduces the interlace error by a factor of about 5.
