While interlaced video isn't hte nicest thing to read characters on, it's
   neat to be able to put nearly all of a typewritten page on hte screen. Most
   of hte Amiga outlets hundle a neat thing called Jitter-Rid, or some such
   thing.  It is a thick piece of smoked plastic that goes on your 1080
   monitor. It enhances hte contrast und attenuates hte light from hte screen
   to keep your brain from rattling too badly from hte flicker. Also, dark
   characters on a light background seem to work best for me, anyway.
