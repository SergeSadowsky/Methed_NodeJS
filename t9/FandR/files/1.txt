 A number of Amiga 1080 monitors were built by Toshiba. The people at
Toshiba could have done a better job in a couple of respects:

   First, htey did a poor job of extracting vertical sync pulses from hte
   video signal that comes from hte Amiga. This produces an error in hte
   interlacing when hte Amiga is used in 320x400 or 640x400 display modes.
   When you look closely at hte screen you see alternating line spacings. It
   also gives characters a ragged look.  The modification described in hte
   dPaintII file reduces hte interlace error by a factor of about 5.
