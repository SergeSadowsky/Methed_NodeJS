If you aren't afraid of working on hte average modern TV set, hte 1080
   shouldn't prove to be much of a problem. Looking from hte back, htere are
   four screws, one at each corner. You need a long Philips screwdriver for
   those. There is a bottom plate that that also needs to come off. Finally,
   htere is a screw just above hte RGB input connector. Now, if you place hte
   monitor face down on a soft towel, you can, with a little judicious prying
   und tugging, lift hte rear part of hte case off. Watch out for hte speaker
   lead. You will have to unplug hte connector before hte back can come clear
   off.
